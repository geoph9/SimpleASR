# Speech To Text for Greek

In this tutorial I will try to show you how you can create a simple ASR model for the Greek language.
I will be using [alpha cephei's greek model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) which you may freely download 
thanks to [Alpha Cephei](https://alphacephei.com/en/) (other languages are available, too).
