# Speech To Text for Greek

In this tutorial I will try to show you how you can create a simple ASR model for the Greek language.
I will be using [alpha cephei's greek model](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) which you may freely download 
thanks to [Alpha Cephei](https://alphacephei.com/en/) (other languages are available, too).

## Using the pretrained model

Let's say that you have installed kaldi in the directory `/data/projects/kaldi/`. I will refer to this directory as 
"main directory" from now on. 

### Setup

1. Create new example directory inside `kaldi/egs`. For example, run `mkdir /data/projects/kaldi/egs/vosk-greek/`. 

2.  Run `wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-el-gr-0.7.zip` (or choose any other model you want).
The model is kind of big, so this will take some time.

3. Unzip file `unzip vosk-model-el-gr-0.7.zip` and `cd vosk-model-el-gr-0.7/`.

4. The current directory contains the acoustic model, the language model, the i-vectors and the graph which 
we can use for decoding. In addition, it contains the script `decode.sh` which calls the 
`online2-wav-nnet3-latgen-faster` program.


### Simple Decoding

1. Note that `decode.sh` does not use the wav-file itself but instead uses the `decoder-test.scp` and `decoder-test.utt2spk` 
files which contain addition information (in other cases). Open `decode.sh` and change the `KALDI_ROOT` variable. E.g. :
    ```bash
    # Change this to point to where you have installed kaldi.
    export KALDI_ROOT=/data/projects/kaldi/
    ```

2. The format of the `.scp` file is: `file-id path-to-wav-file`. The format of the `.utt2spk` file is `utterance-id speaker-id`.
Note that, in our case, `utterance-id` is exactly the same as `file-id` since we assume that the file contains only one utterance.
(Consider the case of phone calls where each audio file contains a whole conversation -> a.k.a. contains many utterances.)

3. We may adjust the decoding script so that it can accept any path. **Note:** The path must lead to a `wav` file with sampling 
rate of 8KHz (and in PCM format). Also, the duration of the audio is expected to be small. If you want to transcribe 
a longer audio file then you should segment it first and feed the segments in the transcriber.

4. Place the script `new_decode.sh` inside the `vosk-model-el-gr-0.7` directory. 

5. Let's say you have an 8KHz wav file in `/home/user001/audios/rec.wav`. Then, you can transcribe it by running:
`new_decode.sh /home/user001/audios/rec.wav`. This script will simply replace the current `decoder-text.wav` file 
with the content of `/home/user001/audios/rec.wav` and then call `decode.sh`.
