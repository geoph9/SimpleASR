# SimpleASR

This tutorial aims at providing some first steps for creating your own kaldi model. 

I will provide different folders with different datasets. Currently, I have only uploaded a guide on building your own digit recognition system. I have used the freely available [Free Spoken Digits Dataset](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset). 

__NOTE1: Cloning this repository will not work on its own. In order to build your own system, clone this repo and follow the steps at README.md.__

__NOTE2: We assume that you have already successfully installed kaldi. A basic prerequisite is that you are also using a Linux system. I am using a Linux subsystem inside my Windows 10 distribution. If not, check [here](http://jrmeyer.github.io/asr/2016/01/26/Installing-Kaldi.html).__
